# SuperKart_Linear_Regression
For this project, I build a regression model for sales predictions.


#Objective:
SuperKart is an organization that owns a chain of supermarkets and food marts providing a wide range of products. It wants to predict the future sales revenue of its different outlets to strategize its sales operation across different tier cities and plan its inventory accordingly. To achieve this purpose, SuperKart has hired a data science firm, shared the sales records of its various outlets for the previous quarter, and asked the firm to develop a suitable model to predict the total sales of the stores for the upcoming quarter.

# Data Description:
The data contains the different attributes of the various products and stores. The detailed data dictionary is given below.

- Product_Id - unique identifier of each product, each identifier having two letters at the beginning followed by a number.
- Product_Weight - the weight of each product
- Product_Sugar_Content - sugar content of each product like low sugar, regular, and no sugar
- Product_Allocated_Area - the ratio of the allocated display area of each product to the total display area of all the products in a store
- Product_Type - broad category for each product like meat, snack foods, hard drinks, dairy, canned, soft drinks, health and hygiene, baking goods, bread, breakfast, frozen foods, fruits and vegetables, household, seafood, starchy foods, others
- Product_MRP - maximum retail price of each product
- Store_Id - unique identifier of each store
Store_Establishment_Year - the year in which the store was established
- Store_Size - the size of the store depending on sq. feet like high, medium, and low
- Store_Location_City_Type - the type of city in which the store is located, such as Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 consists of cities where the standard of living is comparatively higher than its Tier 2 and Tier 3 counterparts.
- Store_Type - the type of store depending on the products that are being sold there like Departmental Store, Supermarket Type 1, Supermarket Type 2, and Food Mart
- Product_Store_Sales_Total - total revenue generated by the sale of that particular product in that particular store.

All but one of the continuous variables are normally distributed. The product allocated area is right skewed. This could be due to the fact that some large products require a larger display area.
