# SuperKart_Linear_Regression
## For this project, I build a regression model for sales predictions.


#Objective:
SuperKart is an organization that owns a chain of supermarkets and food marts providing a wide range of products. It wants to predict the future sales revenue of its different outlets to strategize its sales operation across different tier cities and plan its inventory accordingly. To achieve this purpose, SuperKart has hired a data science firm, shared the sales records of its various outlets for the previous quarter, and asked the firm to develop a suitable model to predict the total sales of the stores for the upcoming quarter.

# Data Description:
The data contains the different attributes of the various products and stores. The detailed data dictionary is given below.

- Product_Id - unique identifier of each product, each identifier having two letters at the beginning followed by a number.
- Product_Weight - the weight of each product
- Product_Sugar_Content - sugar content of each product like low sugar, regular, and no sugar
- Product_Allocated_Area - the ratio of the allocated display area of each product to the total display area of all the products in a store
- Product_Type - broad category for each product like meat, snack foods, hard drinks, dairy, canned, soft drinks, health and hygiene, baking goods, bread, breakfast, frozen foods, fruits and vegetables, household, seafood, starchy foods, others
- Product_MRP - maximum retail price of each product
- Store_Id - unique identifier of each store
Store_Establishment_Year - the year in which the store was established
- Store_Size - the size of the store depending on sq. feet like high, medium, and low
- Store_Location_City_Type - the type of city in which the store is located, such as Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 consists of cities where the standard of living is comparatively higher than its Tier 2 and Tier 3 counterparts.
- Store_Type - the type of store depending on the products that are being sold there like Departmental Store, Supermarket Type 1, Supermarket Type 2, and Food Mart
- Product_Store_Sales_Total - total revenue generated by the sale of that particular product in that particular store.

### All but one of the continuous variables are normally distributed. The product allocated area is right skewed. This could be due to the fact that some large products require a larger display area.

- ### Low-sugar products are the most popular. This makes sense because later, you will see that fruits and vegetables are what people buy most.
- ### Fruits and vegetables, snack foods, frozen foods, dairy, and household goods are the top 5 products.
- ### Store_Id - unique identifier of each store Store_Establishment_Year - the year in which the store was established. OUT004 should be the stores established in 2009. More stores were established this year. You see this in the year-established graph.
- ### Medium-sized stores have the most stores.
- ### Tier 2 has the most stores.
- ### Supermarket type 2 has the most stores.
- ### Supermarket type 2 and OUT004 are probably the same. This would indicate that supermarket type 2 was established in 2009. The store type and the year established have a 1:1 mapping.

  ## Inspect the correlation of the continuous variables

- ### Product weight and Product MRP are highly correlated with product store sales totals, which is the target variable.
- ### Product weight and product MRP have a strong correlation as well.
- ### Everything else does not correlate.


## Bivariate analysis. Inspect categorical variables vs. target variable product store sales totals.

### Here are the things that generate the most revenue:
- ### Food items
- ### Low-sugar items
- ### Fruits and Vegetables and Snack foods
- ### Store id OUT004
- ### The year 2009 (This is the year they had the most expansion)
- ### Medium sized stores
- ### Tier 2 stores
- ### Supermarket type 2

- ### Prices from sugar content are roughly the same.
- ### High-size store prices look to be higher. Although medium size generated more revenue.
- ### OUT003 prices are higher. OUT004 generates more revenue.
- ### Looks like department stores have higher median prices
Supermarket type 2 generates the most revenue.
Department stores may have higher ticket items
- ### Median prices look the same for all product types, which is interesting.

## Inspect product types with respect to store size and tier vs. sales totals

### Small Store

- ### Regardless of the store size, tier, or type, fruits and vegetables, and snack foods are the top 2.

- ### The VIF of Product_Weight, Product_Allocation_Area, Product_MRP, Product_Id_char_FD are less.
- ### The VIF for dummy variables can be ignored, which is expected that they would have a high VIF.
- ### But the continuous variables should not have high VIF.
